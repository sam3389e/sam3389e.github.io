            <h2>Paddle Boarding</h2>
            <p>I started paddle boarding my freshman year of college. My roommate introduced me to it because she competes in races and loves it.
                I then got my own inflatable paddle board (the picture above) for Christmas. I have since competed in a couple recreational races
                and I now love it. I've always lived by the water, so really anything on the water is what I love to do.

            <h2>Penn State Hockey</h2>
            <p> I started going to Penn State hockey games my junior year of college. I absolutely loved it. The roar zone is the best
                student section for sure. Since then I go to games as much as I can. Hockey just seemed so much better than football.
                I hope to go to NHL games once in a while once I graduate.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I have always loved games since I was a kid. Whether it's board games or video games, I'm all for it. I own more than 
                enough board games. I also have an Xbox One, Switch, Wii, and Xbox 360 (I still even have both my Nintendo DS's). Once I
                 graduate, my goal is to invest in a great PC. I want to be able to play games as well as develop them.
